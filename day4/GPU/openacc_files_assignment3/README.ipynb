    "The compiler has analyzed the loops in our two main functions and scheduled the iterations of the loops to run in parallel on our GPU and Multicore CPU. The compiler is usually pretty good at choosing how to break up loop iterations to run well on parallel accelerators, but sometimes we can eek out just a little more performance by guiding the compiler to make specific choices. First, let's look at the choices the compiler made for us. We'll focus on the `calcNext` routine, but you should look at the `swap` routine too. Here's the compiler feedback for that routine:\n",

    "The main loops on interest in `calcNext` are on lines 49 and 51. I see that the compiler has told me what loop clauses it chose for each of those loops. The outermost loop is treated as a *gang* loop, meaning it broke that loop up into chunks that can be spread out across the GPU or CPU cores easily. If you have programmed in CUDA before, you'll recognize that the compiler is mapping this loop to the CUDA thread blocks. The innermost loop is mapped instead to *vector* parallelism. You can think of a vector as some number of data cells that get the same operation applied to them at the same time. On any modern processor technology you need this mixture of *coarse grained* and *fine grained* parallelism to effectively use the hardware. Vector (fine grained) parallelism can operate extremely efficiently when performing the same operation on a bunch of data, but there's limits to how long a vector you can build. Gang (coarse grained) parallelism is highly scalable, because each chunk of work can operate completely independently of each other chunk, making it ideal for allowing processor cores to operate independently of each other.\n",

There are many ways to alter and optimize our loops, though it is up to the programmer to decide which route is the best to take. At this point in the lab series, you should be able to begin parallelizing your own personal code, and to be able to achieve a relatively high performance using OpenACC."
